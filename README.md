This repository contains code for my final year undergraduate project at ECE Department, SSN College of Engineering, Chennai, India. 

The code cotains an adaptation of the U2Fusion (Unsupervised Fusion) algorithm for the Sen 1-2 dataset for SAR-Optical Image Fusion. 

U2Fusion is an unsupervised fusion algorithm originally founded for problems like multi-focus and multi-exposure image fusion.

In this project, the U2Fusion algorithm has been modified and adapted to fuse a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical (Multi-Spectral) Images to produce a single, high-resolution colorized SAR image.
